# Programmable completion for the Bazaar-NG bzr command under bash.
# Source this file (or add it to your ~/.bash_completion or ~/.bashrc
# file, depending on your system configuration, and start a new shell)
# and bash's completion mechanism will know all about bzr's options!
#
# This completion function assumes you have the bzr-bash-completion
# plugin installed as a bzr plugin. It will generate the full
# completion function at first invocation, thus avoiding long delays
# for every shell you start.
